    "\n",
    "## Summary of Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, I experimented with various prompt engineering strategies to summarize and extract information from product reviews using GPT. The prompts were designed to focus on different aspects, such as summarizing in a limited number of words, extracting only positive or negative feedback, and highlighting specific topics like customer service or shipping.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Effectiveness of Different Prompts\n",
    "\n",
    "- **General Summarization:** The model performed well when asked to generate concise summaries, capturing the main points of each review within the specified word limit.\n",
    "- **Focused Summarization:** When prompts asked for summaries with a focus (e.g., shipping, price, customer service), GPT generally included relevant details, but sometimes also mentioned unrelated aspects.\n",
    "- **Extraction of Positives/Negatives:** The model was able to extract positive and negative points as bullet lists or short summaries. However, it occasionally included neutral or slightly off-topic points, especially if the review was ambiguous.\n",
    "- **Customer Service and Complaint Extraction:** GPT accurately identified and summarized customer service experiences and complaints, but sometimes omitted minor details or softened negative feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variations That Didn't Work Well\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Topic Drift:** In some cases, when asked to focus only on a specific aspect (e.g., shipping), the summary still included unrelated product features or general impressions.\n",
    "- **Hallucination:** There were rare instances where GPT inferred details not explicitly stated in the review, such as assuming a positive experience with support when the review was neutral.\n",
    "- **Strict Extraction:** When asked to extract only positive or negative points, the model sometimes included points that were not strictly positive/negative, indicating some difficulty in strict classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lessons Learned\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Prompt Specificity Matters:** The more specific and clear the prompt, the more likely GPT is to return focused and relevant information.\n",
    "- **Word Limits Help:** Imposing word or bullet limits encourages concise and targeted responses.\n",
    "- **Model Limitations:** GPT can sometimes generalize or infer beyond the text, leading to minor hallucinations or topic drift.\n",
    "- **Iterative Refinement:** Testing multiple prompt variations is valuable for finding the most effective approach for a given summarization or extraction task.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, prompt engineering is a powerful tool for guiding GPT's outputs, but careful design and iterative testing are necessary to achieve optimal results, especially for focused or nuanced tasks."
